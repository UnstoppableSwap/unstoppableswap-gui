      The swap provider has taken a long time to lock their Monero. This might
      mean that:
      <ul className={classes.list}>
        <li>
          There is a technical issue that prevents them from locking their funds
        </li>
        <li>
          They are a malicious actor (unlikely)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      There is still hope for the swap to be successful but you have to be extra
      careful. Regardless of why it has taken them so long, it is important that you refund the
      swap within the required time period if the swap is not completed. If you
      fail to to do so, you will be punished and lose your money.
